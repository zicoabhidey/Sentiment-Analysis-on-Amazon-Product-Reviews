"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt. IP.  I love it!  Just had to order a stainless 3 qt. liner pot for it (with a silicon lid) in case I need to put something in it in the refrigerator ... or use it to cook something separately.","13 Sep 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Royal2","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is...","29 Aug 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","HomeForSummer","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . . The worst thing is i am writing this and the machine goes in smokes for no reason. What do i do? This thing is just going in smokes unplugged.

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout.

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt.

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . .

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work.

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=3

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt. IP.  I love it!  Just had to order a stainless 3 qt. liner pot for it (with a silicon lid) in case I need to put something in it in the refrigerator ... or use it to cook something separately.","13 Sep 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Royal2","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is...","29 Aug 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","HomeForSummer","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . . The worst thing is i am writing this and the machine goes in smokes for no reason. What do i do? This thing is just going in smokes unplugged.

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=4

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=5

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt.

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . .

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot.

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands.

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=6

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . . The worst thing is i am writing this and the machine goes in smokes for no reason. What do i do? This thing is just going in smokes unplugged.

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=7

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt. IP.  I love it!

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is...","29 Aug 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","HomeForSummer","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=8

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . .

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot.

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"Perfect Tiny Living appliance","I use this for everything! How did I live without this before??? I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once! This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!","08 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aMspEBsIL._SY88.jpg","Yes","The Galavan","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9

"Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT","UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous ""soccer mom spaghetti"" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying? Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :) ******** ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier.","24 Apr 2018","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","DLO","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9

"Didn't Realize How Much I Needed the Mini !!","I've been using the 6 qt IP, but always had way too much food left over.  I bought the 3 qt mini for use in our camping trailer.  However, I ended up dragging it home and using it there.  It's a perfect size for just the wife and myself.  Things have gotten to the point that my wife says, ""I don't want to cook.  Pull out the little pot (IP mini) and make dinner (spaghetti, soup, whatever).""  My fault for becoming proficient with the use of the Instant Pots.  When we have company to dinner, I use the 6 qt. IP.  I love it!

"Bad customer service!","I was loving my instant pot, bragging to all about it. Making my dogs food was so easy! I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response! Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days.... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason. It should be posted though people should know what kind of company this is...","29 Aug 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","HomeForSummer","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9

"DANGER","Im not sure what happened here, because i know this is a good product. I attempted to cook food, my first run, and 15 minutes later The entire machine is in smokes. Quickly filled my kitchen and house with a horid smoke of burnt plastic. There were sparks coming off the bottom of the machine while it was turned on . I quickly unplugged the machine and turned it over to inspect the counter . I ask myself what would have happened if it had caught fire, or exploded in my face . The sound it was making seemed like it was going to.  As you see the plastic melted, it was liquid all over my counter, and it was not easy to clean off the counter or my tainted hands. The bottom of the machine and remaining wires where bright, scolding red. I ruined kitchen towels, had to shower again before going to work. I was running late because of the ordeal i had to deal with. Forced to eat out with my wife because, just wasted the food being cooked wich was about to be amazing. . . .

"I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It","I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (""Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!""), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various sauté settings heat to?  Things like that. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said ""almost"", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out. The sauté function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit) For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons). The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word ""on"".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really ""dropping in"", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either ""let the pressure dissipate on its own"" (natural pressure release), or ""force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance). Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a ""dump everything in at once and turn it on"" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes sautéing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little ""stains"" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think ""Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?"" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the ""imprints"" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my ""Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot"" post). Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.) Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot. You definitely will want this steamer basket for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get this steamer basket and steaming rack / trivet set .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or ""PIP"") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from ""I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal"" to ""I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot"" to ""I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time). For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel pot-in-pot 'dessert insert' pan set , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them. You will also want this separate glass lid that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the sauté function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception: Pressure Cooker Perfection I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!): Vegan Pressure Cooking: Delicious Beans, Grains, and One-Pot Meals in Minutes And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one: O M Gee Good! Instant Pot Meals, Plant-Based & Oil-free ..and this one: Vegan Under Pressure: Perfect Vegan Meals Made Quick and Easy in Your Pressure Cooker And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes! Happy Instant Potting!","16 Apr 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Anne P.

"MAJOR FAILURE","This pot is designed to not work. The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The ""solution"" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker.","01 Jan 2018","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","BLS","1.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=9

"The Instant Pot is a Game Changer (plus a few tips)","If you haven’t used an instant pot before you’re missing out. It’s probably the most versatile kitchen appliance I own, oven/range included. I use it to make everything from eggs and chili to chicken curry and pulled pork. You name it, I’ve probably made it. After using it for almost a year here are some of the things that stick out to me: Pro’s: Build Quality:  High end materials and attention to detail in the build.  I’ve had mine for nearly a year and it’s still in perfect condition.  These are built to last. Versatile: It literally does it all, I feel like I’m still learning new things every week that it’s capable of from sauteing to steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking, rice cooking, frying, making yogurt… Time & Money Saver: Cooking with the instant pot is like time traveling haha.  I can cook frozen chicken in under 15 minutes. No preheating an oven, thawing the chicken, baking for 30 minutes… etc  I toss in a few frozen chicken breasts, a little water, and some spices.  15 minutes later I’m eating. It’s faster than ordering/picking up take out. Con’s: Sealing Rings: My biggest gripe with the instant pot is that the sealing ring can somewhat trap scents and flavors.  Obviously you don’t want salmon flavors or scents in your oatmeal (or maybe you do I won’t judge.) Good news is you can solve this by buying some extra silicone rings for your instant pot and using them for similar flavor profiles. Use one ring for savory stuff, one for meats, etc… I use these rings and they work great for me. They cost a little more than some of the other rings I saw but they use premium silicone and with how much I cook it makes sense.  That said you could probably use any of the highly rated rings out there. Stuck on Food: This one is probably only relevant for some of the lazier folks out there like me but I recommend either cleaning or soaking the inner pot within an hour after cooking.  I’ve left it overnight a handful of times and it can be a little bit of a headache to scrub out any stuck on stuff. That said the inner pot is thick aluminum so you can use pretty abrasive cleaning tools without worrying about damaging it. Overall I think the instant pot probably one of the best purchases I’ve made in the last year. It’s actually made it easier and faster for me to cook healthy meals compared to getting takeout. This alone has paid for the instant pot 30 times over (I would eat out a lot…) As long as you aren’t lazy about cleaning out the pot after cooking and buy a set of high quality sealing rings (make sure they are different colors!) you’ll be set.","19 Aug 2019","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/719v9T4lFBL._SY88.jpg

"Nearly three years later, what I’ve learned","Updated 12/9/2018 Still going strong, still using the heck out of it.  Made a cheesecake last night after I cooked a corned beef!  Glad to have two different color sealing rings so the cake doesn't smell like corned beef.  The Instant Pot folks have a two pack of rings, red and blue, quite handy.  I use red for everyday and blue for sweets.  I also finally broke down and bought a steamer basket with a handle, works better than the one I mention below. Updated: 9/26/2017 I’ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don’t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac’n’cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it. It’s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn’t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn’t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You’ll know what ‘hangry’ means then! There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density – and you’ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it’s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I’m done, it’s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to ‘stay warm’ on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn’t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though. Now to some specific tips: Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don’t need them. Don’t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black ‘ledge’ that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it’s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don’t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order. I use the RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel 3 Quart Wide Rim Mesh Basket for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It’s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn’t work well – it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base– don’t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though). I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot. Dexas Mini Silicone Oven Mitt with Raised Nibs, Red . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it’s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, crème brulee).  I bought the Nordic Ware Leakproof Springform Pan, 7 Inch which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6” cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9” one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don’t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine! This is a great purchase – you’ll love it!","06 Dec 2015","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717uLnLULKL._SY88.jpg

"IF YOU WANT GOOD HEALTHY FAST MEALS THEN YOUVE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE!","I love it! Wholesome food has just been turned into fast food in our house!!! My husband and I have jobs that sometimes require long hours without much notice. So getting home at 7pm when you've started at 7am can leave you exhausted. And when your hungry your first though is ""uuuugh I don't want to have to cook and WAIT an hour or 2 for it to get done! No no! I've seen and heard such amazing reviews I finally decided to try it. I bought the 6qt and loved it so much that 2 weeks later I also bought the 8qt. I use the 6qt for my side dishes and the 8qt to cook my main meats! The lid and inner pot go right in to the dishwasher (after you pull apart the sealing ring on the lid so it can be washed and sanitized properly) so next to no clean up. You can buy your meats in bulk. Just cut your portions, season then freeze! This pressure cooker will even cook from frozen! Collard greens in 10 minutes. Macaroni and cheese from scratch 10 mins. Whole, free range pasture raised young chicken 30 mins and sooooo juicy! Cheesecake 20 mins! Whole rack of pork ribs 45 mins and literally falling off the bone. Thick porkchops in a cream of mushroom sauce made from scratch 15 mins! I encourage you all to try this out and you'll wonder how you went without. We very rarely if ever eat fast food or go to a restaurant now. In the time it takes my husband to jump in the car drive down to get fast food, order, pay and head home whatever I threw in the Instant Pot has about 5 or 10 more mins until done. Same thing goes with a restaurant. In the amount of time it takes for my food to come out after you go in, wait to be seated, and finally order.......15 more mins at home and I'll have the same thing but I know the ingredients I used to make it. NON GMO, ORGANIC, FAIR TRADE and not irradiated with a microwave to reheat! I love both of my Instant Pots. I come from a family of home cooked meals, back when moms and dads worked full time 40+ hrs a week, did homework with the 4 of us kids when they got home and then mom would cook a meal (mostly from scratch with appropriate ratios of veggies to meats to starchy foods) while dad washed behind her as she cooked! I'll always prefer the taste of healthy home cooked meals over processed any day.  But time and energy was fading and it became a challenge to be the same superwoman my mom was (minus the 4 kids)!!! And now I can fit nutritious home cooked meals for my husband and I into our 40-60hr work week! It's two fold! The more healthy home cooked meals you eat the more energy you have and the better you sleep. Until you do it you have no idea what you're missing out on! Go on give it a go! If you know your way around a kitchen......you'll love all of the things you can do with this!  And just like cell phones and submitting mobile reviews on Amazon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it :-) THANK YOU AMAZON AND INSTANT POT!!!!","04 Nov 2016","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","MeanicaK.","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"I like it","This is my first electric pressure cooker, my others are stove top. I actually bought it because of a story I saw on Facebook about a woman getting burned when it ""blew up"". I had to find out how that could happen. I am not new to pressure cookers or how they work. So I do know that in certain circumstances it can happen. But usually because of human error. First off - you have got to clean EVERY part on the lid after each use. That means taking out the ring, taking apart the rest of the lid pieces and washing all the holes. I use a thick pipe cleaner. Food and oils can build up and block the holes and that is not good. Lightly oil your rubber gasket after each use then wipe it dry with a paper towel to get off any extra. Do NOT over fill the cooker. Those guide lines on the side are there for your protection. If you over fill it can cause food to clog the vents and that is never good. This has a lot of safety features and what she said happened in the story just could not have happened the way she said. The most dangerous part of this pressure pot is the steam release and if you are not paying attention you will get hurt. When you open the steam release put a towel over your hand and keep your face away. That steam comes out fast and hot and you will get scalded if you have your face over it. turn the knob from below the steam hole and never over the top. It's not a toy but it can be so much fun if you do it right. I figure what happened to that lady is she released the vent with her face there and she just did not want to admit she made a mistake. She said she let it stand for 40 minutes to cool, the steam vent had dropped and no steam came out the release and when she took the lid off it was still under pressure. It has a safety that does not allow the lid to come off under pressure. After 40 minutes it should have been cooled down enough, the other possibility is she filled it too full and it stuck the valve shut so it looked like the pot had cooled enough. But she also said she released the steam release and nothing came out. It has a pretty good instruction book. Facebook has some good groups that are dedicated to pressure pots and you can get a lot of information there. There are also websites but I found some of the facebook sites faster for asking point blank questions. All in all, I think this is a very good unit and I use it a lot and really enjoy it. Still can't bring myself to turn it on and leave the house all day - but I don't trust my crock pot either, lol. I think it is money well spent just for the ease of preparation and not having to slave over the stove for hours and things get done faster. Pay attention to the steam release and you are ok.","12 Jan 2019","Size: 8Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Lemons","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"

"Love it. Bought a SECOND ONE & One really nice feature that makes it even better...","I love my instant pot. It replaced my slow cooker altogether. I don't use the the programed cycles. Most recipes just call for xx minutes. The one “ feature” nobody has mentioned is that you can keep the food in the pot, refrigerate it, and reheat it in the same pot! This is a HUGE difference between this and a slow cooker with a ceramic pot! Because you can sauté in it, add the rest of the ingredients, cook them, and save it in the same pot, then warm it up in the same pot saves a lot of time, fuss and cleanup. I bought a 6 quart and accessory set initially. It was a bit big for just two people. But I liked it so much i bought a second one, a 3 quart, with TWO inner pots and a 3 qt accessory set. I often have both sets in use at the same time (make sue you have separate circuits in your kitchen), I work long hours and do most if my cooking in weekends. Because i can warm up food in the same pot, i can get home late, put one of the pots in the cooker, have a glass if wine and then enjoy a good hot meal. I roasted a chicken in the oven (dinner 1 & 2) put the carcass into the 6 qt with onion, celery, carrots & garlic & spices cooked for several hours the next day. Strained it, picked meat off bones, added rice & fresh vegetables. Have great soup for a couple of days.

"Almost the same as my previous IP","My old IP died after 6 years of frequent use and I could not live without one.  There is one improvement over my old one:  it beeps when it reaches pressure and begins timing.  The new cord is shorter than the old one and is removable, which means that sometimes it is not in properly.  But I highly recommend the IP.  This model is good for the two of us since I like to cook for more than one day in advance.  I uses my IP to make legumes, grains, soups and stews.  I occasionally use it to steam veggies and making hard boiled eggs is easy.  The new one did not come with the lovely recipe book that I received with the first one, but since there are so many recipes available on line and there are now many cookbooks for the IP, I don't think that is an issue.","04 Nov 2020","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","David and Shoshana Cooper","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"If I could only own one kitchen appliance this would be it!","I really love this pot.  I will probably buy another one real soon. In fact you really don't even need a stove if you had two or three of these babies. I would buy four if I thought my wife would allow me to use that much counter space. I am vegan and the Instant Pot works wonders with beans, oatmeal, potatoes and about any other vegetable.Before I bought it, If I didn't wake up an hour or two early then I wasn't having steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. So, I would spend an hour stirring on the stove or slow cooking overnight to make a huge pot of it on Monday and keep it in the fridge and heat it up in the microwave throughout the week. Now, I can wake up, put the steel cut in the Instant Pot take a shower get dressed go down stairs and voila`! perfect hot steel cut oatmeal that is even better than you get at Panera. You can cook beans without presoaking them. It takes longer but not like the old days where if your beans weren't pre-soaked. Forget it! get a can out of the pantry. Some people say it's just a glorified pressure cooker but it is so much more! The pressure cooking feature is great but it also is perfect for slow cooking and it's better than using a frying pan to saute`  Check out the recipes on the internet and you will be dying to get an Instant Pot! I will say that there is some trial and error involved in learning the optimal time, temperature and when to manually release the pressure or let the pressure naturally release on different foods. Read the charts in the recipe book that comes with it and that gives you a good baseline.","27 Oct 2017","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","R.

"Easy to use and quiet","I love love love this Instant Pot.  Everything about it is perfect.  It's easy to use, easy to clean up, easy learning curve.  The pressure cooking is quiet and quick.  I would recommend getting the magnet cooking guides for quick reference on the time needed for cooking.  I got a couple of cooking books as well, but haven't needed them yet. However, I was so pleased with the pot, that I returned to get all the accessories.  My favorite is the bbq ribs.  Got them good and crispy with the saute', then a quick pressure cook, then into the oven with the bbq sauce under the broiler.  They were so tender!  Tasted like more!  I liked so much I bought one for my sister. I recommend especially if you have ever had a regular pressure cooker blow chicken on your ceiling (yes, that was me).","11 Aug 2020","Size: 6Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","JustFlo","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
"One of the best investments I’ve made","This is by far one of the best investments I’ve made.. I’ve made some of the yummiest soups ever and it’s so easy!! The only thing I wish was a little different is the steam release valve. It’s a bit intense and the steam is so hot the little droplets can burn. But it is definitely not a deal breaker and I absolutely love love love this insta pot. Excited to learn how to make more things like yogurt!","08 Oct 2020","Size: 3Qt Pattern Name: Pressure Cooker","","Yes","Dawn","5.0","Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1 Electric Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Steamer, Sauté, Yogurt Maker, Warmer & Sterilizer, Includes Free App with over 1900 Recipes, Stainless Steel, 6 Quart","https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product-reviews/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_3?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=10"
